This project is about hybrid modeling for a balanced Diabetes classification dataset. It uses classification and clustering techniques to form a prediction.

Methods used:
-Feature importance
-K-means Clustering(elbow method and silhoutte score) 
-Classification(Logistic regression, xgboost, knn) and GridSearchCV used for hyperparameter tuning
-Ensemble learning (voting, boosting, and stacking)
-Model evaluation using different kinds of techniques and evluators such as learning curves, confusion matrix, and other statistical measures such as recall, precision, accuracy, ROC curve, Optimal threshold determined using Youdenâ€™s J statistic and etc.
